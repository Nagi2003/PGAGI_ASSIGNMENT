### Project Overview

TalentScout is an AI-powered hiring assistant chatbot designed to streamline the initial screening process for technical candidates. The chatbot collects candidate information, generates customized technical interview questions based on their tech stack, and allows candidates to submit answers. The responses are saved for further evaluation, enhancing efficiency in the hiring process.
